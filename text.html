                <h1>MS DHONI</h1>
        <b>M.S. Dhoni, in full Mahendra Singh Dhoni, (born July 7, 1981, Ranchi, Bihar [now Jharkhand] state, India), Indian cricketer whose rise to prominence in the early 21st century culminated in his captaincy of the Indian national team that won the one-day Cricket World Cup in 2011.

            Dhoni made his international debut in 2004. His talent with the bat came to the fore in an innings of 148 runs against Pakistan in his fifth international match. Within a year he joined the India Test team, where he quickly established himself with a century (100 or more runs in a single innings) against Pakistan. Despite his inexperience, Dhoni took over the captaincy of the one-day side in 2007 and led India to the Twenty20 (T20) world title. Series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka, among others, moved India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time in December 2009. Dhoni was honoured for his play with the ICC One Day International Player of the Year Award in 2008 and 2009. In the 2011 one-day World Cup, Dhoni’s dashing innings of 91 not out—in front of a home crowd in Mumbai—paved the way for India’s victory over Sri Lanka in the final. He also led India to an appearance in the semifinals of the 2015 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni stopped serving as India’s captain in 2017, having led his country in 331 international matches, the most for a captain in the sport’s history. Three years later he retired from international competition.</b>

                <h1> NATARAJAN</h1>
                <b>Natarajan made his first-class debut for Tamil Nadu in the 2014–15 Ranji Trophy on 5 January 2015.[11] He made his Twenty20 debut for Tamil Nadu in the 2016–17 Inter State Twenty-20 Tournament on 29 January 2017.[12] He made his List A debut for Tamil Nadu in the 2018–19 Vijay Hazare Trophy on 20 September 2018.[13]

                    In February 2017, Natarajan was bought by the Kings XI Punjab team for the 2017 Indian Premier League for ₹3 crore (equivalent to ₹4.2 crore or US$520,000 in 2023).[14] In January 2018, he was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2018 IPL auction.[15]
                    
                    On 26 October 2020, Natarajan was named as one of four additional bowlers to travel with the India cricket team for their tour to Australia.[16] On 9 November 2020, he was added to India's Twenty20 International (T20I) squad, replacing Varun Chakravarthy who was ruled out due to an injury.[17] Ahead of the first One Day International (ODI) match, he was added to India's squad as a cover for Navdeep Saini, who was suffering with a back spasm.[18][19] Natarajan made his ODI debut for India against Australia on 2 December 2020</b>

                <h1>VIRAT KOHLI</h1>
    <b>Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of the Indian national team for T20Is, following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.</b>
